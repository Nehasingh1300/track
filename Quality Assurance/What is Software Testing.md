#Quality Assurance And Testing
It is context(the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.) while rive testers and developers to make software.<br>
<br>
## Software Testing <br> 
Software development and delivery <br> 
Structured Approach in learning
       <br> need to adapt testing effectively in software development
        
### Software TESTERS
Skills
            <br>    Context which drive them
<br><br>
## Basics For Software Testing
Requirements <br> 
Testcases
       <br> Build
        <br>Bugs
        <br>Automation
        <br>Innovation
        
## Why automated testing is needed?
Make testing faster
   <br>     Less errors
       <br> Smart
        <br>foolproof
<br>
## TestCase Design Technique
Equivalence Partitioning
   <br>     Boundary Value Analysis
       <br> Decision table
        <br>State Transition
        <br>Use Case Based
<br>
## Software 
set of instruction
   <br>     purpose
       <br> who are stakeholders

## Testing
User want good quality software
       <br> Comparing against requirements
