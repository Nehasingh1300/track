# We will see how to use Selenium WebDriver API to find elements on a Web page and interact with these elements

Clicking links -> opening HTML Page -> text, image, picture, input box and may more stuff <br>
When we want to automate browser interaction using Selenium, we need to tell Selenium how to find a particular element or set of elements on a web page programmatically and simulate user actions on these elements. <br>
## Take Away 
You can right click on the line of code to find xpath as compared to find it.

## **FindElementMethod**<br>
The findElement() method returns an instance of a WebElement that is found in the page DOM based on specified locators, also called search criteria, else no element found.<br>
The findElements() method returns a list of WebElements matching the search criteria, else return empty list.<br>
