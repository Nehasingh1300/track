**1.** The only way to genuinely understand your emotions is to spend enough time thinking through them to figure out where they come from and why they are there.<br><br>
**2.** Self-management is your ability to use your awareness of your emotions to stay flexible and direct your behavior positively. This means managing your emotional reactions to situations and people.<br><br>
**3.** Social awareness is your ability to accurately pick up on emotions in other people and understand what is really going on with them. This often means perceiving what other people are thinking and feeling even if you do not feel the same way.<br>
Listening and observing are the most important elements of social awareness. To listen well and observe what’s going on around us, we have to stop doing many things we like to do. We have to stop talking, stop the monologue that may be running through our minds, stop anticipating the point the other person is about to make, and stop thinking ahead to what we are going to say next. It takes practice to really watch people as you interact with them and get a good sense of what they are thinking and feeling. At times, you’ll feel like an anthropologist. Anthropologists make their living watching others in their natural state without letting their own thoughts and feelings disturb the observation. <br><br>
**4.** Relationship management is your ability to use your awareness of your own emotions and those of others to manage interactions successfully. This ensures clear communication and effective handling of conflict.<br>
# **Chapter 4**
If you typically yell when you are feeling angry, for example, you have to learn to choose an alternative reaction. You must
practice this new reaction many times before it will replace the urge to yell. In the beginning, doing something other than yelling when you are angry will be extremely difficult. But each time you succeed, the new pathway is strengthened. Eventually the urge to yell is so small that it’s easy to ignore. <br>
**Action Plan**<br>
1. Choose one EQ skill you want to work on(choose one EQ at a time)<br>
2. Choose three EQ strategies to improve your skills<br>
3. Choose EQ mentor who can help you track your growth<br>
4. Expect success, not perfection ; practice,practice,practice ;be patient<br>
5. Measure your progress<br>

***MY PLAN***
1. Self Awareness (Anger Management)<br>2. I will try to control anger whenever I feel it, I will stay away from things that make me angry, I will ignore.<br>3. Pranjal Sharma<br>4. Measuring my progress from this moment.<br>
Be patient
and give yourself credit for even the smallest bits of forward momentum. As you start noticing things about yourself that you weren’t previously aware of (things you aren’t always going to like), you are progressing.<br>
***1. Suspending judgment of emotions allows them to run their course and vanish<br>2. To fully understand the ripple effects of your emotions, you’ll need to spend some time reflecting upon your behavior. You’ll also need to ask other people how they are affected by your emotions. The more you understand how your emotions ripple outward, the better equipped you’ll be to choose the type of ripples that you want to create.<br>3. Rather than avoiding a feeling, your goal should be to move toward the emotion, into it, and eventually through it.When you ignore or minimize an emotion, no matter how small or insignificant, you miss the opportunity to do something productive with that feeling.<br>4. To better understand the physical effects of your emotions, try closing your eyes the next time you have a few moments alone. Feel how fast or slow your heart is beating. Notice the pace of your breathing. Determine how tense or relaxed the muscles are in your arms, legs, neck, and back. Now, think of a couple of events from your life—one positive and one negative—that generate strong emotions. Think through one of these events in enough detail that you can feel your emotions stir. Take note of the physical changes that accompany the feelings.<br>5. Knowing who pushes your buttons and how they do it is critical to developing the ability to take control of these situations, maintain your poise, and calm yourself down. . Having a clear understanding of who and what pushes your buttons makes these people and situations a bit less difficult because they come as less of a surprise.<br>6. Your objectivity would allow you to step out from under the control of your emotions and know exactly what needed to be done to create a positive outcome.<br>7. You should write about time spent at work and home—nothing is off limits. In just a month, you’ll begin to see patterns in your emotions, and you’ll develop a better understanding of your tendencies. <br>8. Part of self-awareness is knowing what you’re going through even if you can’t totally change it. Admit to yourself that your bad mood is hanging a cloud over everything you see, and remind yourself that your moods are not permanent. Your emotions change all the time, and low moods will pass if you allow them to.<br>9. The excitement and energy you enjoy during a good mood paint a rosy picture of all you encounter. This leaves you far more likely to make impulsive decisions that ignore the potential consequences of your actions <br>10. With a little practice, you can trace your emotional reactions back to their origins and understand the purpose of your emotions. The surprising thing about this strategy is that just paying attention to your emotions and asking yourself good questions like these are enough to help you improve. Can you remember the first time you reacted like this and with whom? Are there similarities between then and now? Can anyone evoke this reaction in you or only specific people? The better you understand why you do the things you do, the better equipped you’ll be to keep your emotions from running the show.<br>11. Take a sheet of paper and separate it into two columns. List your core values and beliefs in the left column and anything that you’ve done or said recently that you aren’t proud of in the right column. Is what you value in alignment with the manner in which you conduct yourself? If not, consider alternatives to what you said and did that would have made you proud of yourself, or at least more comfortable. <br>12. how you feel is reflected in how you look. Your facial expressions, posture, demeanor, clothes, and even your hair all say important things about your mood.<br>13. Spot your emotions in books, song, movies<br>14. Self-awareness is the process of getting to know yourself from the inside out and the outside in. The only way to get the second, more elusive perspective is to open yourself up to feedback from others, which can include friends, coworkers, mentors, supervisors, and family. <br>15. You will benefit tremendously from learning to recognize your first signs of stress. The human mind and body—at least when it comes to stress—have voices of their own. They tell you through emotional and physiological reactions when it’s time to slow down and take a break.***
